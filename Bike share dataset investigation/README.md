## Data Wrangling

The code involved in the data wrangling process can be found in the `wrangle_data.py` file. The data wrangling process includes the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: The data is collected from the respective websites of the companies.

2. **Data Assessment**: The data Types, Missing Values, Duplicates, etc. are assessed. and issues were identified for the cleaning process.

3. **Data Cleaning**: The issues identified in the assessment process are cleaned. These issues involved 
    - Droping unrelevant columns
    - Fixing data types
    - Removing Outliers
    - Handling Missing Values
    - Unifying Stations' Coordinates for Further analysis 
    - Combining the 3 datasets into one dataset

## Insights

**`Tableau`** was used to visualize the data and gain insights. The dashboard can be accessed below

[![Tableau Dashboard](assets/Dashboard.png)](https://public.tableau.com/views/Bike-ShareDatasetsAnalysis/Statistics?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

The Dashboard is fully interactive and contains filters on the following 
- City
- Month
- User Type
- Rideable Type
- Selecting Top N Stations
- Different Hours of the Day


Some of The gathered insights Are:

- For `Chicago`, As the weather gets warmer, the number of rides increases along the coast of Lake Michigan
