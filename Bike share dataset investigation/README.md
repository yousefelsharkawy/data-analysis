- `start_station_id`: Unique identifier for the station where the ride started
- `end_station_name`: Name of the station where the ride ended
- `end_station_id`: Unique identifier for the station where the ride ended
- `start_lat`: Latitude of the station where the ride started
- `start_lng`: Longitude of the station where the ride started
- `end_lat`: Latitude of the station where the ride ended

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Wrangling

The data wrangling process, detailed in the `wrangle_data.py` file, involves:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering data from the respective company websites.
2. **Data Assessment**: Evaluating data types, missing values, duplicates, etc., and identifying issues for cleaning.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Addressing identified issues, including:
   - Dropping irrelevant columns
   - Fixing data types
   - Removing outliers
   - Handling missing values
   - Unifying station coordinates for further analysis
   - Combining the three datasets into one comprehensive dataset

## üîç Insights

**`Tableau`** was used to visualize the data and derive insights. The interactive dashboard can be accessed below:

[![Tableau Dashboard](assets/Dashboard.png)](https://public.tableau.com/views/Bike-ShareDatasetsAnalysis/Statistics?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

The dashboard includes filters for:
- City
- Month
- User Type
- Rideable Type
- Selecting Top N Stations
- Different Hours of the Day

### üåü Key Insights

Here are Few examples on using the dashboard to derive insights:

- **Chicago**: As the weather warms up, the number of rides increases along the coast of Lake Michigan.

  *Comparison: March 2024 (left) vs. December 2023 (right)*

  Rides along the coast tend to have longer durations regardless of the month.

- **New York City**: The highest number of rides are in South Hoboken and Grove St Path.

  *Comparison: Late 2023 (left) vs. early 2024 (right)*

  Similar to Chicago, ride durations are generally higher around the Potomac River regardless of the month.

- **Favorite Hours**: Peak ride times are around 8 am and between 4-6 pm.
