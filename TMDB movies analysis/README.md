# TMDb Movie Data Analysis

This project is an analysis of a dataset of movie information from The Movie Database (TMDb). The dataset contains information about 10,866 movies, such as popularity, budget, revenue, cast, director, runtime, genres, release date, and ratings. The project aims to explore the dataset and answer some questions about the characteristics of successful and unsuccessful movies.

## Questions

The project tries to answer the following questions:

- Does the amount of budget affect the rating of a movie?
- Does the duration of a movie affect the rating?
- What are the changes of different features of movies over the years?
- What are the movies with the most gains and most losses?
- What are the different statistics of genres?

## Data Wrangling

The project performs some data cleaning and manipulation steps to prepare the dataset for analysis. These steps include:

- Removing duplicated rows
- Dropping non-relevant columns
- Handling missing values
- Converting incorrect data types
- Creating new columns for analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The project uses descriptive statistics and visualizations to explore the dataset and answer the questions. The project uses Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to perform data analysis and visualization. The project also uses markdown cells to explain the findings and observations.

## Conclusions

The project draws some conclusions based on the exploratory data analysis. These conclusions include:

- Movies with higher budget generally received higher ratings
- Movies with longer duration generally received higher ratings
- Popularity, budget, revenue, and ratings of movies increased over time, while duration decreased over time
- Avatar, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Titanic, Jurassic World, and Furious 7 were the movies with the most gains
- The Warrior's Way, The Lone Ranger, The Wolfman, The Pacific, and Double Wedding were the movies with the most losses
- Drama, Comedy, Thriller, Action, and Romance were the most common genres
- Old movies were generally better than modern movies

## Limitations

The project also acknowledges some limitations of the analysis. These limitations include:

- The dataset may not be complete or accurate as it is from a third-party source
- The dataset may not be representative of all movies as it only covers a certain period and region
- The analysis may be affected by outliers and skewed distributions
- The analysis may not imply causation as it only explores correlations and associations
- The analysis may not account for other factors that may influence movie success or failure
